# Spherical harmonics
The spherical harmonics are defined by the following formula

where the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?P_l^m"/> are the associated Legendre polynomials. They satisfy the following equation:

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?r^2\nabla^2Y_{lm}(\theta, \phi)=l(l+1)Y_{lm}(\theta, \phi)"/>.
